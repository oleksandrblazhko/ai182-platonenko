| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1 | Do not expose security details in error messages. Implement Default error handling page. Set Deployment Method to Retail in IIS. Use only approved symmetric block ciphers and key lengths. Use approved block cipher modes and initialization vectors for symmetric ciphers. Use approved asymmetric algorithms, key lengths, and padding. Use approved random number generators. Do not use symmetric stream ciphers. Use approved MAC/HMAC/keyed hash algorithms. Use only approved cryptographic hash functions. Verify X.509 certificates used to authenticate SSL, TLS, and DTLS connections. | 
| 2 | Ensure that the application does not log sensitive user data. Ensure that Audit and Log Files have Restricted Access. |
| 3 | Encrypt sections of Web App's configuration files that contain sensitive data. | 
| 4 | Ensure that type-safe parameters are used in Web Application for data access. |
| 5 | Implement Content Security Policy (CSP), and disable inline javascript. Enable browser's XSS filter. Access third party javascripts from trusted sources only.  Enable ValidateRequest attribute on ASP.NET Pages. Ensure that each page that could contain user controllable content opts out of automatic MIME sniffing. Use locally-hosted latest versions of JavaScript libraries. Ensure appropriate controls are in place when accepting files from users. Disable automatic MIME sniffing. Encode untrusted web output prior to rendering. Perform input validation and filtering on all string type Model properties. Ensure that the system has inbuilt defences against misuse. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Implement input validation on all string type parameters accepted by Controller methods. Avoid using Html.Raw in Razor views. Sanitization should be applied on form fields that accept all characters e.g, rich text editor. Do not assign DOM elements to sinks that do not have inbuilt encoding. | 
| 6 | Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to authenticate to Web Application. | 
| 7 | Verify X.509 certificates used to authenticate SSL, TLS, and DTLS connections. Ensure that authenticated ASP.NET pages incorporate UI Redressing or clickjacking defences. Validate all redirects within the application are closed or done safely. | 
| 8 | Applications available over HTTPS must use secure cookies. All http based application should specify http only for cookie definition. | 
| 9 | Explicitly disable the autocomplete HTML attribute in sensitive forms and inputs. Perform input validation and filtering on all string type Model properties.  Validate all redirects within the application are closed or done safely. Enable step up or adaptive authentication. Implement forgot password functionalities securely.  Ensure that password and account policy are implemented. Implement input validation on all string type parameters accepted by Controller methods. | 
| 10 | Verify X.509 certificates used to authenticate SSL, TLS, and DTLS connections. |
| 11 | Enable ValidateRequest attribute on ASP.NET Pages. Encode untrusted web output prior to rendering.  Avoid using Html.Raw in Razor views. Sanitization should be applied on form fields that accept all characters e.g, rich text editor. Do not assign DOM elements to sinks that do not have inbuilt encoding. | 
| 12 | Set up session for inactivity lifetime. Implement proper logout from the application. | 
| 13 | Ensure that auditing and logging is enforced on the application. Ensure that log rotation and separation are in place.  Ensure that Audit and Log Files have Restricted Access. Ensure that User Management Events are Logged. |
| 14 | Ensure that sensitive content is not cached on the browser.
SDL Phase:	Implementation | 
| 15 | Do not expose security details in error messages. Implement Default error handling page. Set Deployment Method to Retail in IIS. Exceptions should fail safely. ASP.NET applications must disable tracing and debugging prior to deployment. Implement controls to prevent username enumeration. |
| 16 | Applications available over HTTPS must use secure cookies. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). |
| 17 | Ensure that administrative interfaces are appropriately locked down. | 
| 18 | Ensure that sensitive data displayed on the user screen is masked. | 
| 19 | Ensure that the application does not log sensitive user data. Ensure that Audit and Log Files have Restricted Access. | 
| 20 | Do not expose security details in error messages. Implement Default error handling page. Set Deployment Method to Retail in IIS. Use only approved symmetric block ciphers and key lengths. Use approved block cipher modes and initialization vectors for symmetric ciphers. Use approved asymmetric algorithms, key lengths, and padding. Use approved random number generators. Do not use symmetric stream ciphers. Use approved MAC/HMAC/keyed hash algorithms. Use only approved cryptographic hash functions. Verify X.509 certificates used to authenticate SSL, TLS, and DTLS connections. | 
| 21 | Ensure that administrative interfaces are appropriately locked down. Enforce sequential step order when processing business logic flows. Ensure that proper authorization is in place and principle of least privileges is followed. Business logic and resource access authorization decisions should not be based on incoming request parameters. Ensure that content and resources are not enumerable or accessible via forceful browsing. | 
| 22 | Ensure that authenticated ASP.NET pages incorporate UI Redressing or clickjacking defences. Ensure that only trusted origins are allowed if CORS is enabled on ASP.NET Web Applications. Mitigate against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks on ASP.NET web pages. | 
| 23 | Use resource (SAS like) tokens (derived using master keys) to connect to Cosmos DB instances whenever possible. Scope the resource tokens to permit only the privileges necessary (e.g. read-only). Store secrets in a secret storage solution (e.g. Azure Key Vault). |
| 24 | Restrict access to Azure Cosmos DB instances by configuring account-level firewall rules to only permit connections from selected IP addresses where possible. | 
| 25 | Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in Azure Document DB. | 
| 26 | Use minimum token lifetimes for generated resource tokens. Rotate secrets (e.g. resource tokens, access keys and passwords in connection strings) frequently, in accordance with your organization's policies. | 
| 27 | Do not expose security details in error messages. Implement Default error handling page. Set Deployment Method to Retail in IIS. Use only approved symmetric block ciphers and key lengths. Use approved block cipher modes and initialization vectors for symmetric ciphers. Use approved asymmetric algorithms, key lengths, and padding. Use approved random number generators.
